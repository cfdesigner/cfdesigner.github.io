title: Hire Black people
subtitle: Recognising racist personal networks
---
I find it difficult to talk about racism. I do not regularly have to consider race precisely because, for the most part, I am surrounded by white people. I have very rarely worked on a team with Black people. I have rarely been involved in the hiring of a Black person. I have benefitted greatly from a system that overwhelmingly benefits white people.

In a recent design update to the company, I said that we were going to change how we hired designers. I said that biased platforms and biased personal networks translated to biased pipelines, biased candidate pools, biased hires, and a biased culture. My personal network is highly biased towards white people and against Black people.

Out of the hundreds of connections I have on LinkedIn, less than 4% are Black. Out of the many more hundreds I follow on Twitter, less than 2% are Black. Many positions get filled through referrals and through outbound sourcing from personal networks. Today, my own personal network would almost never result in hiring a Black person.

Many people over the next few weeks will rush to an internet list of Black creatives to hire (and to be clear, the many talented people on those lists should absolutely be hired), but as with many structural issues, we have to work the policies, and not the exceptions. Racist policies, systems and networks will persist if we don't address them.

If your personal network—as mine is today—is biased against Black people and you do nothing to recognise and change it, it will be biased in 6 months, and a year, and 5 years. It was easy for me to say _we're going to change how we hire designers_ but it didn't actually change anything. The real work is in practicing daily anti-racist habits.

In the past I might have claimed that I wasn't racist because I didn't intentionally exclude Black people from the hiring process. But I didn't consistently and regularly _include_ Black people in the hiring process, either. It's taken me a while to see that my actions (or lack thereof) were racist, and that changing nothing is racist.

When I say _hire Black people_, I don't mean _hire Black people because they're Black_, and I don't mean _hire Black people because of the protests happening right now_. I mean that if your personal network reflects the reality of the world, then your hiring pipeline should too. If that's true, you should already be _more likely_ to hire Black people.

But that's not enough. If my personal network is biased towards white people and against Black people, it's very likely that my interview loop is biased against Black people. It's likely that the growth frameworks I author are biased against Black people. It's likely that my performance and promotion policies are biased against Black people.

I'm not advocating for hiring Black people as the end goal, I'm advocating for it as a start. I'm advocating for hiring Black people. For creating anti-racist environments that support Black people. For promoting Black people. For fairly compensating Black people. For _deconstructing_ racist policies, and for _creating_ anti-racist policies.
