### Note from the author

This product is the ongoing line of enquiry being followed as a result of research carried out at the University of Worcester, UK. This is a live document, and as such, is liable to amendments, extensions, and complete rewrites. This is done in an effort to [design transparently](/2014/10/24/designing-in-the-open/), though whether this is ultimately a successful approach will only be revealed over time.
