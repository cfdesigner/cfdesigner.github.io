### Note from the author

This product is the ongoing line of enquiry being followed as a result of research carried out at the University of Worcester, UK. This is a live document, and as such, is liable to amendments, extensions, and complete rewrites. This is done in an effort to [design transparently](/2014/10/24/designing-in-the-open/), though whether this is ultimately a successful approach will only be revealed over time. 

### Introduction

As with any growing product, there are myriad elements that the designer creates to serve the needs of many. Whilst this is a good thing, as designers are indeed decision makers, there must be an ongoing and up-to-date documentation of the decisions made, in order to both better inform those that come after them, and indeed those that they may collaborate with.

For *Coach*, there are two requirements for such documentation: one to be interacted with by content publishers, such as research councils and universities, and one by those tasked with contributing to the development of the product. This section will explore how both of these might work, as well as how they differ from each other.

On the one hand, product development documentation speaks to those—hopefully—well informed on the technology employed, but unfamiliar with particular naming conventions, and so on. On the other hand, publishiner documentation must make no presumptions, but rather cater to the needs of those that have interacted with something similar, as well as those that haven't any experience whatsoever, as the task of publishing content could fall upon many new staff.
