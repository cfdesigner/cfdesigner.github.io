### Note from the author

This product is the ongoing line of enquiry being followed as a result of research carried out at the University of Worcester, UK. This is a live document, and as such, is liable to amendments, extensions, and complete rewrites. This is done in an effort to [design transparently](/2014/10/24/designing-in-the-open/), though whether this is ultimately a successful approach will only be revealed over time. 

### Introduction

Illustration practice has been considered under many lights throughout history, yet seems to be coming into its own, in so many ways. The illustration aspect of *Coach* will explore whether illustration—like design and engineering, in the context of product design and technology—can be automated, to an extent. Like the website, these illustrations will be created in modules. Allow me to explain why:

A technology company, or a web product, has a lot of moving parts, and those parts increase, decrease, and change at a phenomenal rate. We have, to a large extent, created systems to mitigate this within design and engineering, whether that's creating pattern libraries, style guides, Sass mixins, and so on. Illustration, however, should it be for the purpose of user-onboarding, promotion, or storytelling, is often created anew.

For the most part, there is likely valid reason, but there may be use-cases where modular illustration could be extremely useful, especially in prototyping and user-onboarding. In these instances, it would be hugely beneficial for any member of the team—artistically trained or not—to create artwork that helps to either visualise or explain a process. 

In basic user-onboarding, for example, there may be only so many variables subject to change, such as the mood of the piece, to visually connote whether a process is likely to be easy or difficult, or the type of device a user has, where an accurate representation could aid in comprehension.

Illustration in this context then becomes automated not only in its creation, but also by context: a web app that works across multiple platforms and forms of technology could serve appropriate images to illustrate a 'tap' for mobile, versus a 'click' for desktop. This could also be extended to geographic contextualisation, serving images with names and locations familiar to the user.
