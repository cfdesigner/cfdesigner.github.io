<h1 class="m-b-4">Craig Frost - London Based Designer &amp; Strategist</h1>

I'm a London Based designer &amp; strategist with a penchant for interaction design. My work largely comprises understanding and acting upon the needs of users in order to create usable and accessible products and services.

In order to transform needs into actionable and realistic goals, I work closely with stakeholders to both educate on the benefits of user-centric strategy, and to implement over the long term to enable clients to meet goals whilst remaining resource-conscious.

I graduated university with a first class degree in design &amp; illustration, and continue to dedicate a significant amount of time to education, research, speaking &amp; mentoring.
