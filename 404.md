## Room 404, Ms.? Are you  quite sure? 

I'm supposed to tell you that you're lost; that the page you're looking for doesn't exist, and that perhaps you should head back home, but let's not, this time.

There are myriad opportunities to be discovered by stepping off the beaten track, and this is your opportunity to sit back and enjoy a story that not everyone will find, simply because you were bold enough to type an invalid URL - or perhaps, of course, because I've posted one somewhere.

So, without further ado, let's begin.
