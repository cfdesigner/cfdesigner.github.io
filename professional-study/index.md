title: A Study of the Professional
---
### Note from the author

This essay is the ongoing line of enquiry being followed as a result of reading design at the University of Worcester, UK. This is a live document, and as such, is liable to amendments, extensions, and complete rewrites. This is done in an effort to [design transparently](/2014/10/24/designing-in-the-open/), though whether this is ultimately a successful approach will only be revealed over time. 

### Introduction

The words that follow shall discuss the authors opinion of 'the professional': what it means, in practice, to be a professional, and how one might portray their personal or brand image as such. These are the opinions of the author, and not intended to be, in any way, instructional. That said, should anything be of great interest, feel more than welcome to reach out and [discuss it](mailto:c.frostwr1@gmail.com).

### Branding

A personal brand—such as a logo—is something I have stayed away from thus far. Not because I disagree with the idea, as such, simply that I feel as though it may be difficult to distill my practice into a mark, and that to struggle to do so would be disingenuous. As part of this study, I will attempt to synthesise the facets of my professional practice into something resembling a brand, though I daresay I'll be unlikely to utilise it.

This exercise will help me to define what is important to me, as a practitioner, and how I can further contribute to the canon of design, and also learn from it, in understanding how my peers go about creating something so personal. 

### Web Presence

My home on the web has, as a result of this study, been recently deconstructed, sorted, and re-assembled, this time though into something that reflects my values and beliefs as a practitioner.
