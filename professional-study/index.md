title: A Study of the Professional

### Note from the author

This essay is the ongoing line of enquiry being followed as a result of reading design at the University of Worcester, UK. This is a live document, and as such, is liable to amendments, extensions, and complete rewrites. This is done in an effort to [design transparently](/2014/10/24/designing-in-the-open/), though whether this is ultimately a successful approach will only be revealed over time. 

### Introduction

The words that follow shall discuss the authors opinion of 'the professional': what it means, in practice, to be a professional, and how one might portray their personal or brand image as such. These are the opinions of the author, and not intended to be, in any way, instructional. That said, should anything be of great interest, feel more than welcome to reach out and [discuss it](mailto:c.frostwr1@gmail.com).

### Branding

A personal brand
