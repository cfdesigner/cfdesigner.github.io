## Information

These are the innards of my portfolio, it is hosted on github and processed by Jekyll.

Feel free to look around, and if motivated to, correct any errors I may have missed, in my doubtless haste,

As a designer, I'm learning about creating for the web at a rapid rate, and I'm also trying to design in the open. For this reason, there will be times when elements within these folders do not make complete sense, though I shall refrain from making commits in instances where it may confuse. In those instances, changes will appear in the secondary branch until such a time that they are ready to be merged.

If you'd like to talk to me about my website, design, or anything else, feel free to [contact me](mailto:c.frostwr1@gmail.com)

Thanks.
