title: And for You, Madam?
---

Allow me to tell you a story about a fictional friend of mine—let's call her Alice—who's had a tough day at work. She's a product manager for a tech startup where, before her arrival, every new idea was taken on board and executed. Now she's been left with figuring out how exactly they're going to bring focus to the product. She'd written down hundreds of ideas throughout the day, but not one of them seemed to fit. As she'd already worked hours after closing, Alice decided to head home, and thought she might grab some dinner at a restaurant on the way, and this, is how it went:

***

Alice walks into the first establishment, famished after a long day of work at the office. There's no counter to wait at, but she politely stands near the entrance, pending the arrival of the front-of-house staff to show her to a seat. 

After a few minutes, and not a sign of anyone that could possibly help, she walks tentatively toward a table that appears to be free, and after a quick glance around, takes a seat. She picks up the menu, but immediately feels that what she has in her hands must not be the available selection: there's only one item on it, cooked in one way, and with no sides.

Alice would, if she were able to, ask the waiting staff if there was a larger menu, but alas, there is still no one around. A brief scan of the room reveals but a handful of fellow diners, all eating the same thing. 

She asks one of them if they know quite what's going on, but they don't seem to understand her confusion. They come here all the time, they love it here! Why on earth would anyone go anywhere else?

Alice decides that this isn't for her, promptly picks up her things, and leaves the restaurant. No matter, there are bound to be countless other eateries on the route home. 

***

The second restaurant Alice comes across seems much more likely to fill her needs: it's extremely busy, with lots of diners, and nearly as many staff!

As soon as Alice steps over the threshold, a member of staff is stood in front of her. He insists on hanging her coat up, though she'd much rather keep it on her person. He seems polite though, and very eager to help, and so she allows him to take her coat.

Upon reaching the table, Alice wonders if someone is already sat there: there are menus of every kind scattered across the surface, and a healthy selection of foods stuffed into bowls, baskets, and all manner of other containers. 

The waiter assures her that no one is sat there, that the menus are all different, and that she's welcome to the food that's present. Interestingly though, some of it is complimentary, some of it is not, and it isn't obvious which is which. 

Whilst trying to look through all of the options available to her, Alice is approached by four waiters in the space of as many minutes. Five now. Six!

Between the myriad choices of food and the over-eagerness of the staff, Alice begins to get a little tired with the whole thing. She'd just like something to eat, and for the staff to be there when she needed them, and not when she didn't.

Despite her growing hunger, Alice picks up her things and leaves the restaurant, certain that she wouldn't otherwise make it through the meal without several disturbances, only to find that the food wasn't very satisfactory. No one, after all, can do so many things to an extremely high standard.

Alice had almost given up on the idea of dining out, resigning herself to the idea that it might be less hassle to cook for herself, though she didn't feel like it, after the day she'd had.

Just then, she noticed a little place out the corner of her eye: if she hadn't been glancing around longingly she could have easily missed it, as could anyone else! It's almost as though it blended in with its surroundings. Alice walked inside and waited for a member of staff to greet her, which, fortunately, happened within seconds. 

The waiter offered to take her coat, but she expressed how she'd like to keep it with her, before the member of staff escorted her to a table. 

Alice picked up the menu: a small selection. Just big enough, actually, and there were a few options to customise the dish, but not so many that it was overwhelming, or would change the flavour of the dish. 

Alice picked what she'd like, content with the fact that there was time to look over everything on the menu before deciding. The waiter was paying attention, and so made his way over to take her order. 

She didn't have to wait long, and the short wait was most certainly worth it: the food was outstanding! The waiter asked her if everything was okay around midway through the meal, but otherwise left her to enjoy it in peace. 

A minute or two after finishing, the waiter cleared the table, and offered her a coffee, which she accepted. As she sat there, enjoying her drink, and looking out of the window, Alice thought about how calm she now was. After a somewhat stressful—and eventful–day, this restaurant, the staff, and the meal, had made her feel wonderful. 

Alice then pulled a pen from her bag, slid a napkin toward herself, and wrote something down:

The next day at work, was better.
