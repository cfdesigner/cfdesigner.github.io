title: Designing in the Open
---

For a long time, my process has been all but a secret, except to a select few peers and clients. Not for any particular reason, I might add, it simply never occurred to me that it may be of great interest to others, and perhaps that's the case. Nevertheless, from this point forward, I'll be publishing my thoughts as I think them, warts and all. 

During the life of any product I might be working on, a text editor will be open, caret blinking, urging me to type. Without this, I would doubtless take far longer to reach worthy design decisions. Writing can help one to process thoughts and emotions, to reflect critically on the thoughts of yesterday, and to keep an absolute record of the intrigue that each of us is imbued with.

This file will no longer save to my desktop or Dropbox alone, but will be published here, to the web, each time I hit save. This could result in a text that doesn't entirely make sense, temporarily, and will more than likely result in a stream of thoughts that are later altered, contradicted, or completely removed, though I'll try to avoid the latter. 

So, welcome to my text editor. Please, go gently on me.
