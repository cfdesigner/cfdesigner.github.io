title: Sharing just a little, but doing it a lot
---
For longer than I care to admit, I've been telling myself and others that I plan to start sharing more; to finally write some thoughts down on that thing I've been speaking about forever. Today, I'm starting.

It's incredibly easy to avoid posting something until you've designed the blog you'd like; to avoid building it until you've chosen just the right stack; to avoid sharing anything until the idea is crystal clear.

I'm going to try a another approach: sharing just a little, but at more regular intervals. In writing, designing, building, or most anything, the discipline is often more important than any one creation.
