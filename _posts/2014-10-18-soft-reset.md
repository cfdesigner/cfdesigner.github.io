title: Soft Reset
---

For the past few years, I've been designing, but I feel as though the word doesn't quite describe a specific activity, anymore, let alone an expected outcome of such an activity. A teacher can teach; can have been teaching, but, alas, if nobody's been learning anything, it doesn't count for much.

It's for this reason that I'm hitting the soft reset button on my career path, my outlook, and the way in which I choose to contribute to the canon of design.

For the past two years I've been studying, having made the decision to obtain a degree in design, in order to better place myself when critiquing the work of others, and looking to expand the body of critical discourse around the discipline.

I'm now in my third and final year, and I'm using the time to work on a product I'm truly passionate about: [*Coach*](/coach/product)â€”a product that redefines how we might carry out research on the web. 

So, I've quit design to start practicing Design, by solving real problems, and iterating on my work to ensure the products I help create contribute to the quality of work in the field, rather than the quantity.

As you'll see, my site is now fairly [bare-bones](/an-explanation). It focuses on its basic function: presenting my work, my writing, and allowing those who need to contact me to do so. 

I've also removed past blog entries, and will be going forward with a particular tone and language, in order to both better clarify my thoughts, and, hopfully, to provide valuable insights to my peers.

If you have anything you'd like to talk to me about, please don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:c.frostwr1@gmail.com) and start a discussion.
