title: On Branding, or Lack Thereof
---

There have been occasions when I’ve flirted with the idea of creating a brand for my practice, many of them. The occurrence of these occasions, however, seems to lengthen, whilst the length of their consideration seems to shorten, rather considerably.

A personal brand—much like any other brand—must surely have longevity, must be trustworthy, must be all encompassing. Speaking for design practitioners, however—and my sincerest apologies if the following description doesn’t resonate—we are afflicted with the frequent changing of our minds.

This, far from criticism, is a compliment greater than it may first appear. We change our minds not because of distraction, or discontent, but because we learn, and through learning we make better decisions; more informed decisions. 

There aren’t many disciplines that involve such a degree of dedication. A dedication that compels us not to consider our work as simply a resource or asset, but as a gift: to ourselves and to those we build for; that compels us to reflect, write, and share with others, with the only guaranteed return on investment being a world that is better to live in tomorrow than it was today.

Creating a brand for my practice; constructing an image that reflects my beliefs, ethics, and intrigue as a practitioner, then, appears somewhat disingenuous. How, though, would others identify me if not by a mark?

The majority of the designers I have an affinity with also happen to be fantastic writers, and the ways in which I identify  them are far more nuanced than a mark. It should be noted that the majority, yet again, do not have marks—or at least, no longer have them, presumably having reached a similar conclusion to mine.

Those identifications are as subtle as their tone, or use of language; their advocating or rejection of the Oxford comma; their typeface and layout choices, and how those inform my reading.

It could be argued, then, that a brand is much less a specific asset, such as a mark or logotype, than a nuanced unique identifier. More akin to recognising a loved ones voice than their face. The voice can affect us in ways the face cannot, and can do so regardless of proximity.

One of the aforementioned occasions occurred quite recently, and I took the opportunity to consider which feature I’d rather be identified by: mark or tone; face or voice.

As you may gather, given the glaring lack of visual branding on this site, I’ve decided, conclusively, on the latter. Whilst I understand those that choose to represent themselves with a mark, I have based my decisions on what is important to me, both professionally and personally.

Imagine, for a moment, that you’ve come across a small box in the family attic. In it, a collection of old photographs from past generations of relatives, and a cassette labelled ‘Holidays’. Those photographs are wonderful, visual moments frozen in time. They’re the crooked smile, the kind eyes. They have, without a doubt, a place in this world.

Once finished looking through the photographs, you reach for the cassette. After dusting it off, finding a pen to wind the loose tape back in, and, more than likely, trying to find a cassette player in that same attic, you snap the drawer shut and press play.

A few crackles, first, as the cassette player attempts valiantly  to act with youth, and then the voices: the small giggle of those embarrassed to record their voice because they think they sound a little odd on recordings; the warm, soft tones of those enjoying what appears to be a party, the emotion in every inflection, and the way everyone spoke, back then.

You close your eyes, pop some headphones in, and it’s as though you’re right there with them: at the same party, in the same room. You remember the photographs and how they looked: that crooked smile matches that laugh, those warm wishes match the kind eyes.

Both of those together are wonderful, but if I were only able to choose one, it would always be the latter. I could tell you exactly how Meursault from Camus’ L'Étranger looks, though I’ve never seen him, and I never shall. I can imagine visuals if I have a sound; imagine a face from a voice. 

Taking the time to consider how you would like to be represented as a practitioner is important, rather than simply subscribing to the notion a brand should be a mark.

Take a moment to decide: mark or tone; face or voice.
