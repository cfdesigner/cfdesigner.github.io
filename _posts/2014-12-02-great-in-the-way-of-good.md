title: Great in the Way of Good
---

There’s a moment, every evening, when me and my future wife will sit down and share stories from the parts of our day that the other wasn’t present in, and the six words that comprise the title of this post are ones that have remained on my mind, to such an extent, that I feel compelled to share them, and what they mean to me. 

The context in which they were originally used carried, unfortunately, negative connotations. “We’re letting Great get in the way of Good”, it had been overheard, but with the unspoken subtext of ‘good enough’. In this scenario, ‘Great’ was something achievable, but ‘good enough’ was the furthest the speaker had intended on performing.

The way in which I had first understood the statement, however, carried entirely different connotations. I’ll elaborate, briefly:

Throughout work on a product, a team will evaluate what features will be both necessary and useful, and hopefully include those features in the final build of said product. A feature, though, is only useful if it works well, and there are countless examples on the web of features for features-sake; features that don’t truly fulfil a user need as they should. 

The issue these examples have is that, in attempting to achieve greatness in scale, the team simply produce a collection of features that are, at best, good enough, and at worst, not worthy even of that title. The features exist, but aren’t performing as was intended. 

If, on the other hand, those features were focused on individually, they could be made well; they could be Good, perhaps even Great. The combination of these features, then, would be undoubtedly Great: “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts”.

A glaring example, of course, is Search: many sites have it, but few have a version worthy of discussion. A simple search on a given site can reveal thousands of results, many of them irrelevant, the ones that may be of use situated at the bottom of the list. This feature is likely to cause more irritation than joy, and therefore affects the users judgement of the entire product.

This extends to features that can be monumentally influential in user engagement and retention, such as payments, and how a user is expected to share content with others. These areas often feel like afterthoughts, resulting in experiences that appear disjointed, rather than extensions of the product experience.

When evaluating which features a product would benefit from, it should be ensured each of them—individually—can be well designed, thoroughly tested, and successfully built. Doing so will ensure the product is strong, the team happy, and the users satisfied. Not doing so will doubtless result in an exercise of tail-chasing and discontent.

The statement can now be used as a positive reinforcement of goals and expectations. In considering whether the notion of Great is getting in the way of Good, a team can scrutinise the efforts made on individual components, and ensure the product scales responsibly.

All of this, it could be said, depends on resources: skill, money, staff numbers. There will almost always be necessary sacrifices when building any product, so we must remember that whilst we build for ourselves, we also build for users. We must occasionally kill our darlings to better serve those who offer us the most valuable resource: their time.
